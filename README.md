# dck-wings — Container Management Agent

**dck-wings** is a lightweight REST API daemon for managing containers via [dck](https://github.com/kuranix/dck). It runs as a systemd service on your VDS and provides a HTTP API that frontends (like dck-panel) use to create, start, stop, and monitor containers.

## Quick Start

```bash
bash <(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuranix/dck-wings/main/install.sh)
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Download
curl -sfL https://github.com/kuranix/dck-wings/releases/latest/download/dck-wings-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/dck-wings
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dck-wings

# Install as service
dck-wings --install

# Edit config
nano /etc/dck-wings/config.toml

# Start
systemctl enable --now dck-wings
```
